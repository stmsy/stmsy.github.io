## Solution to Exercise 1.18 of Chapter 1

*Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a non-zero homomorphism, where $$R$$ and $$S$$ are commutative rings with unity, with unity elements $1_R$, $1_S$, respectively. If $$R$$ and $$S$$ are integral domains, show that $$\varphi(1_R) = 1_S$$. Show by an example that this need not hold if the integral condition is dropped (Howie 13).*

**Proof:**
