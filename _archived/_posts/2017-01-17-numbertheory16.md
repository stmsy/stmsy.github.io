## Solution to Problem 19 of Section 4

*Show that if $$n \equiv 4 \mod 9$$, then $$n$$ cannot be written as the sum of three cubes (Dudley 33).*

**Proof:** Since

\begin{matrix}
0^3 \equiv 0 \mod 9, & 1^3 \equiv 1 \mod 9, & 2^3 \equiv 8 \mod 9, \\\\\\
3^3 \equiv 0 \mod 9, & 4^3 \equiv 1 \mod 9, & 5^3 \equiv 8 \mod 9, \\\\\\
6^3 \equiv 0 \mod 9, & 7^3 \equiv 1 \mod 9, & 8^3 \equiv 8 \mod 9 \textrm{,}
\end{matrix}

any sum of three is not equal to $$4 \mod 9$$. So, as desired, $$n$$ cannot be written as the sum of three cubes. *Q.E.D.*
