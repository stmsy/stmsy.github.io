## Solution to Problem 14 of Section 1

*Prove: If $$c \mid ab$$ and $$(c, a) = d$$, then $$c \mid db$$ (Dudley 9).*

**Proof:** Observe first that $$(c, a') = 1$$, where $$a = da'$$. By *Corollary 1* of the section, if $$c \mid ab = c \mid a'db = c \mid a'(db)$$ and $$(c, a') = 1$$, then $$c \mid db$$ as desired. *Q.E.D.*
