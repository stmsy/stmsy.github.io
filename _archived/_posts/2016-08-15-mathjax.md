## Enable MathJax to Support LaTeX

The easiest way to enable [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is to embed the following script in your HTML file.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>
```

Now you should be able to use $$\LaTeX$$ in your GitHub pages, especially the ones generated by Jekyll. For example, 

### Theorem (PoincarÃ© Conjecture):
Every closed 3-manifold $$M$$ with $$\pi_1(M) = 0$$ is homeomorphic to $$S^3$$.

for in-line math or

### Theorem (Fermat's Last Theorem):
For every integer $$n \ge 3$$, there are no $$x, y, z \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$$ that satisfy the equation

$$x^n + y^n = z^n\text{.}$$

for a displayed equation.
