## Solution to Problem 20 of Section 5

*How many multiples of $$b$$ are there in the sequence*

$$a, 2a, 3a, \dots, ba$$

*(Dudley 41)?*

**Solution:** The problem of finding the number of multiples of $$b$$ in the sequence is equivalent to finding the number of solutions for the equation

$$ax \equiv 0 \mod b$$

and this is given by $$(a, b)$$.
