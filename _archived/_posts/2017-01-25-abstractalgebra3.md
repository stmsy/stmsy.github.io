## Solution to Exercise 1.13 of Chapter 1

*Show that a commutative ring with unity having no proper ideals is a field (Howie 12).*

**Proof:** It suffices to show that every $$u$$ in a commutative ring $$R$$ is a unit. Consider the ideal $$\langle u \rangle$$ generated by $$u$$. Since there are no proper ideals of $$R$$ by assumption, $$R = \langle u \rangle$$. So

$$1 = ru = ur$$

for some $$r$$ in $$R$$. Therefore $$u$$ has the inverse $$r$$ and thus $$R$$ is a field. *Q.E.D.*
