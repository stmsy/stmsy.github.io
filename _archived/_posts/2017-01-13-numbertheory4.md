## Solution to Problem 11 of Section 1

*(a) Prove that $$(k, n+k) = 1$$ if and only if $$(k, n) = 1$$.* <br>
*(b) Is it true that $$(k, n+k) = d$$ if and only if $$(k, n) = d$$ (Dudley 9)?*

**Proof:** By *Lemma 3* of the section, $$k + n = k \cdot 1 + n$$ and $$(k, k+n) = (k+n, k) = (k, n)$$. This proves both (a) and (b). *Q.E.D.*
