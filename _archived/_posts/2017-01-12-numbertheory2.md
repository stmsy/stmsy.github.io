## Solution to Problem 9 of Section 1

*Prove that $$((a, b), b) = (a, b)$$ (Dudley 9).*

**Proof:** Let $$(a, b) = d_1$$ and $$((a, b), b) = (d_1, b) = d_2$$. It is easy to see that $$d_1 \geq d_2$$. Moreover $$d_1$$ is definetely a divisor of $$d_1$$ itself and $$b$$. So $$d_1 \leq d_2$$ by definition of greatest common divisor. Thus $$d_1 = d_2$$. *Q.E.D.*
