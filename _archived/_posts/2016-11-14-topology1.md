## Solution to Exercise 5, Section 2 of Chapter I

*In general, let us denote the __identity function__ for a set $$C$$ by $$i_C$$. That is, define $$i_C: C \to C$$ to be the function given by the rule $$i_C(x) = x$$ for all $$x \in C$$. Given $$f: A \to B$$, we say that a function $$g: B \to A$$ is a __left inverse__ for $$f$$ if $$g \circ f = i_A$$; and we say that $$h: B \to A$$ is a __right inverse__ of $$f$$ if $$f \circ h = i_B$$.* <br>
*(a) Show that if $$f$$ has a left inverse, $$f$$ is injective; and if $$f$$ has a right inverse, $$f$$ is surjective.* <br>
*(b) Give an example of a function that has a left inverse but no right inverse.* <br>
*(c) Give an example of a function that has a right inverse but no left inverse.* <br>
*(d) Can a function have more than one left inverse? More than one right inverse?* <br>
*(e) Show that if $$f$$ has both a left inverse $$g$$ and right inverse $$h$$, then $$f$$ is bijective and $$g = h = f^{-1}$$ (Munkres 21).*
