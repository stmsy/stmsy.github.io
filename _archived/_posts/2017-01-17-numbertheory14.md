## Solution to Problem 14 of Section 4

*Show that the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 3 (Dudley 33).*

**Proof:** Since, for every $$n \gt 0$$,

\begin{align}
(n+1)^3 - n^3 & = ((n+1) - n)((n+1)^2 + (n+1)n + n^2) \\\\\\
              & = 3n^2 + 3n + 1 \\\\\\
	      & = 3n(n+1) + 1
\end{align}

and $$(n+1)^3 - n^3 \equiv 1 \mod 3$$, the difference is never divisible by $$3$$. *Q.E.D.*
