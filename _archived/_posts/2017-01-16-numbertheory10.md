## Solution to Problem 13 of Section 2

*True or False? If $$p$$ and $$q$$ divide $$n$$, and each is greater than $$n^{1/4}$$, then $$n/pq$$ is prime (Dudley 19).*

**Solution:** False. Let $$n = 2^4\cdot3^4$$, $$p = 2^3$$ and $$q = 3^2$$. Then both $$p$$ and $$q$$ divide $$n$$ and are greater than $$n^{1/4} = 2\cdot3$$. However $$n/pq = 2\cdot3^2$$ is not prime.
