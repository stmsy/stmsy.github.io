## Solution to Problem 9 of Section 2

*Is it possible for a prime $$p$$ to divide both $$n$$ and $$n+1$$ $$(n \geq 1)$$ (Dudley 19)?*

**Solution:** Suppose that a prime $$p$$ divides both $$n$$ and $$n+1$$. Then there exist $$a$$ and $$b$$ such that $$a \lt b$$, $$n = ap$$ and $$n+1 = bp$$. However,

\begin{align}
n+1 = bp & \Rightarrow ap+1 = bp \\\\\\
         & \Rightarrow 1 = (b-a)p 
\end{align}

and this is contradiction since $$1$$ is not a nonzero multiple of a prime. Therefore it is not possible for a prime to divide the consecutive positive integers.
