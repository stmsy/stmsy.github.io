title: How to Install PIL in Debian

## PIL Already in Debian 8

For Debain 8, it seems that PIL is preinstalled in the system. If not, try the following command

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get install python-pil python-pil-doc python-pil-dbg
```

and, if you like to use a virtual environment ([virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv)) for Python, edit your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` as follows:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```

so that the [system](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/ch-python.html) can look up the PIL module installed by the `apt-get` command. 

I doubt that `pip` won't be really necessary to obtain the module.
